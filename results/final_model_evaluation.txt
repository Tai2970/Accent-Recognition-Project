Final Model Evaluation Report

This report compares our improved Logistic Regression model using PCA-optimized features against the baseline model from Week 3. The improved model achieved 80% accuracy, representing a 14.29% improvement over the baseline's 70% accuracy. Our feature engineering approach using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) successfully enhanced model performance, particularly for Class 1 classification, while both models maintained perfect performance on the majority class (Class 2).

Confusion Matrix Class-by-Class Performance Analysis

Class 0 (Minority Class)

- Baseline Model: All 3 samples misclassified as Class 1 (0% recall)
- Improved Model: All 2 samples misclassified as Class 1 (0% recall)
- Analysis: Both models struggle with this minority class, suggesting inherent difficulty in distinguishing Class 0 from Class 1

Class 1

- Baseline Model: 1 sample correctly classified, with 3 false positives (25% precision, 100% recall)
- Improved Model: 2 samples correctly classified, with 2 false positives (50% precision, 100% recall)
- Key Improvement: The improved model doubled precision while maintaining perfect recall

Class 2 (Majority Class)

- Baseline Model: All 6 samples correctly classified (100% precision, 100% recall)
- Improved Model: All 6 samples correctly classified (100% precision, 100% recall)
- Analysis: Both models excel at identifying the majority class


Our improved model outperforms the baseline because of dimensionality reduction impact, feature quality improvement, enhanced model-feature compatibility and improved class 1 precision. The PCA components capture directions of maximum variance in the data, highlighting the most discriminative aspects of the audio signals. This created clearer separation between classes, particularly between Classes 1 and 2. The PCA also effectively reduced the feature space from raw audio features to 10 principal components, preserving essential patterns while eliminating noise that likely caused overfitting in the baseline model. Despite both models struggling with Class 0 identification, the improved model's superior overall performance justifies its selection as our final model. This project demonstrates that thoughtful feature engineering through dimensionality reduction can significantly enhance model performance even when using the same underlying classification algorithm. Our results validate the approach of using PCA for feature optimization while highlighting specific areas for future improvement, particularly in addressing the minority class classification challenge.
