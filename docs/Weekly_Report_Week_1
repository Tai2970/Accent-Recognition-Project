Project: Accent Recognition System

Team Members:
Tai Truong (Team Leader & Scribe)
James Johnson (Organization)
Kyle Kucharski (Data Manager)
Wissam Almasri (Data & Translation)

Task 1: Choose a Dataset (Kyle & Wissam)
Selected Common Voice + L2-ARCTIC as the primary datasets.
Confirmed that these datasets contain American, British, and Vietnamese-accented English speech.

Task 2: Set Up Work Environment (James)
GitHub repository created and organized.
Python and Jupyter Notebook setup completed.
Installed required libraries: pip install librosa numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib tensorflow torch torchaudio
Initial setup of Google Colab started.

Task 3: Learn About Speech Features (Tai)
Researched key speech features for accent recognition:
MFCCs (Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients) – Captures speech characteristics.
Pitch & Formants – Helps distinguish accent variations.
Prosody (rhythm, intonation, stress) – Used for linguistic analysis.

Next Steps (Week 2)
➡ Kyle & Wissam upload dataset files to GitHub.
➡ James completes Colab notebook and shares the link.
➡ Tai starts extracting MFCCs, Pitch, and Formants once dataset files and Colab are ready.
